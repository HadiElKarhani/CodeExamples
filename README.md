# PerceptiLabs Machine Learning CodeExamples
We have put together code examples for some of the well-known machine learning algorithms discussed in our [Machine Learning Handbook](https://www.perceptilabs.com/resources/handbook). The handbook is a free resource that you can download and use to become more familiar with approaches like linear regression, decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machines (SVMs), clustering, and, of course, neural networks. The handbook goes into the architecture and math behind these powerful algorithms.

We provide Python examples for the following machine learning algorithms in this repo:

* [Neural Network](#neural-network)
* [K-means](#k-means)
* [Decision Tree Classification](#decision-tree-classification)
* [Linear Regression](#linear-regression)

Happy hacking!

## Neural Network

Play around with this code if you want to understand how to build neural networks using [NumPy](https://numpy.org/).

This is a great way to better understand how it works when training a neural network.

In this example, we are using the [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), which is a dataset containing image data of handwritten digits ranging from 0 through 9.

Note that each sample has a corresponding label.

## K-means
Use K-means clustering in its most common form, with seeding and/or constraints.

In this code example, we are using the [IRIS dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris), which is easy to play around with for this task.

## Decision Tree Classification
You can use decision trees for classification, using the Gini index for the split.

In this code example, we are using the Bank Dataset ([data_banknote_authentication.csv](./data_banknote_authentication.csv), which can easily be replaced with another dataset.

## Linear Regression
Here we are providing three different versions of linear regression:

1. Simple Linear Regression
2. Simple Linear Regression using SGD
3. Multi-variable Linear Regression using SGD

In this example, we are using the Insurance Dataset ([insurance.csv](./insurance.csv)) for 1., Wine Dataset for 2. and [ex1data1](./ex1data1.txt) Dataset for 3.
